# Terraform Cloud MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that integrates AI assistants with the Terraform Cloud API, allowing you to manage your infrastructure through natural conversation. Built with Pydantic models and structured around domain-specific modules, this server is compatible with any MCP-supporting platform including Claude, Claude Code CLI, Claude Desktop, Cursor, Copilot Studio, and others.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- MCP (includes FastMCP and development tools)
- `uv` package manager (recommended) or `pip`
- Terraform Cloud API token

---

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/severity1/terraform-cloud-mcp.git
cd terraform-cloud-mcp

# Create virtual environment and activate it
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install package
uv pip install .
```

### Adding to Claude Environments

#### Adding to Claude Code CLI

```bash
# Add to Claude Code with your Terraform Cloud token
claude mcp add -e TFC_TOKEN=YOUR_TF_TOKEN -s user terraform-cloud-mcp -- "terraform-cloud-mcp"
```

#### Adding to Claude Desktop

Create a `claude_desktop_config.json` configuration file:
- mac: ~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
- win: %APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "terraform-cloud-mcp": {
      "command": "/path/to/uv", # Get this by running: `which uv`
      "args": [
        "--directory",
        "/path/to/your/terraform-cloud-mcp", # Full path to this project
        "run",
        "terraform-cloud-mcp"
      ],
      "env": {
        "TFC_TOKEN": "my token..." # replace with actual token
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `your_terraform_cloud_token` with your actual Terraform Cloud API token.

#### Other MCP-Compatible Platforms

For other platforms (like Cursor, Copilot Studio, or Glama), follow their platform-specific instructions for adding an MCP server. Most platforms require:
1. The server path or command to start the server.
2. Environment variables for the Terraform Cloud API token.
3. Configuration to auto-start the server when needed.

## Documentation

The codebase includes comprehensive documentation:

- **Code Comments**: Focused on explaining the "why" behind implementation decisions
- **Docstrings**: All public functions and classes include detailed docstrings
- **Implementation References**: Development documentation now references actual code examples rather than using code snippets
- **Example Files**: The `docs/` directory contains detailed examples for each domain:
  - `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md`: Development standards and coding guidelines with references to actual code
  - `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md`: Guidelines for contributing to the project
  - `docs/models/`: Reference documentation for all model types
  - `docs/tools/`: Detailed reference documentation for each tool
  - `docs/conversations/`: Sample conversation flows with the API

## Troubleshooting

1. Check server logs (debug logging is enabled by default)
2. Use the MCP Inspector (http://localhost:5173) for debugging
3. Debug logging is already enabled in `server.py`:
   ```python
   import logging
   logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
   ```
