# Authentication - Example Conversations

This document shows example conversations with Claude using the Terraform Cloud MCP authentication features.

## Token Validation and User Info

**User**: Can you validate this Terraform Cloud API token: my-tf-token-value

**Claude**: I'll validate your Terraform Cloud API token.

```python
result = await validate_token()
```

I've validated your Terraform Cloud API token. The token is valid and active.

**User**: Can you validate my Terraform Cloud API token?

**Claude**: I'll validate your default Terraform Cloud API token.

```python
result = await validate_token()
```

Your Terraform Cloud API token has been validated successfully. The token is valid and active.

**User**: Who am I logged in as with this token?

**Claude**: I'll check your user information using your Terraform Cloud API token.

```python
user_info = await get_terraform_user_info()
```

You are logged in as:

- **Username**: jsmith
- **Name**: John Smith
- **Email**: john.smith@example.com
- **User ID**: user-v3xpEKQxYS7L8jTo
- **Account Status**: Active
- **Two-Factor Authentication**: Enabled
- **Site Admin**: No

Your token has access to manage the following organizations:
- example-org
- hashicorp-demo
- terraform-testing

**User**: Does my token have the necessary permissions for workspace management?

**Claude**: Let me verify the permissions associated with your token.

```python
user_info = await get_terraform_user_info()
```

Yes, your token has the necessary permissions for workspace management. Here are the relevant permissions I found:

**Token Permissions:**
- Organization management: Full access
- Workspace management: Full access
- Teams management: Read-only access
- Run operations: Full access
- Variable management: Full access
- State management: Full access

You have full permissions to create, update, delete, and manage workspaces in all the organizations your token has access to. You should be able to perform all workspace management operations without issues.
