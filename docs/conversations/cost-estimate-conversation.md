# Cost Estimate Management Conversation

This file demonstrates Claude's ability to interact with the Terraform Cloud MCP to retrieve and analyze cost estimate information.

## Getting a Cost Estimate by ID

**User:** Can you check the cost estimate for my latest infrastructure changes? The cost estimate ID is ce-BPvFFrYCqRV6qVBK.

**Claude:** I'll retrieve the cost estimate details for you right away.

```python
from terraform_cloud_mcp.tools import cost_estimates
import asyncio

async def get_cost_estimate_info():
    # Use the provided cost estimate ID
    cost_estimate_id = "ce-BPvFFrYCqRV6qVBK"
    
    # Get cost estimate details
    result = await cost_estimates.get_cost_estimate_details(cost_estimate_id)
    
    return result

cost_estimate = asyncio.run(get_cost_estimate_info())
```

Here's the summary of your cost estimate:

- **Status**: Finished
- **Prior Monthly Cost**: $0.00
- **Proposed Monthly Cost**: $25.49
- **Change in Monthly Cost**: +$25.49 (100% increase)
- **Resources Analyzed**: 4 total (3 matched, 1 unmatched)

The estimate shows that your infrastructure changes will add approximately $25.49 to your monthly costs. This is from new resources being added since your prior cost was $0.00.

## Finding a Cost Estimate from a Run

**User:** How do I find the cost estimate for a specific run? I have run ID run-pQtfN5XSe8zaJ2UF.

**Claude:** I'll show you how to find the cost estimate for your specific run ID.

```python
from terraform_cloud_mcp.tools import runs, cost_estimates
import asyncio

async def get_run_cost_estimate():
    # Get run details using the provided ID
    run_id = "run-pQtfN5XSe8zaJ2UF"
    run_result = await runs.get_run_details(run_id)
    
    # Extract the cost estimate ID from the run's relationships
    if "error" in run_result:
        return {"error": f"Failed to get run details: {run_result['error']}"}
    
    relationships = run_result.get("data", {}).get("relationships", {})
    cost_estimate_data = relationships.get("cost-estimate", {}).get("data", {})
    
    if not cost_estimate_data:
        return {"message": "This run does not have a cost estimate associated with it"}
    
    cost_estimate_id = cost_estimate_data.get("id")
    if not cost_estimate_id:
        return {"message": "Cost estimate ID not available"}
    
    # Get cost estimate details using the extracted ID
    return await cost_estimates.get_cost_estimate_details(cost_estimate_id)

result = asyncio.run(get_run_cost_estimate())
```

I found the cost estimate for your run. Here are the details:

- **Cost Estimate ID**: ce-8cZKNpyP3R2fBaXD
- **Status**: Finished
- **Prior Monthly Cost**: $127.32
- **Proposed Monthly Cost**: $158.76
- **Change in Monthly Cost**: +$31.44 (24.7% increase)
- **Resources Analyzed**: 18 total (16 matched, 2 unmatched)

Your run will increase costs by $31.44 per month. The two unmatched resources are likely new resources being added that don't have previous cost data.

## Understanding Cost Estimate Error

**User:** I tried to look at a cost estimate but got an error. The ID was ce-ZXcY12AbPq9LkMnR.

**Claude:** Let me check what might be causing the error with that cost estimate ID.

```python
from terraform_cloud_mcp.tools import cost_estimates
import asyncio

async def check_cost_estimate_error():
    cost_estimate_id = "ce-ZXcY12AbPq9LkMnR"
    result = await cost_estimates.get_cost_estimate_details(cost_estimate_id)
    return result

error_result = asyncio.run(check_cost_estimate_error())
```

I checked the cost estimate with ID ce-ZXcY12AbPq9LkMnR and found the following issue:

The cost estimate appears to have an error status. Here are the details:

- **Status**: Errored
- **Error Message**: "Failed to calculate costs: Provider AWS returned error: Resource pricing data unavailable for region eu-west-3"
- **Timestamp**: Started at 2023-06-15T14:23:18Z, errored at 2023-06-15T14:23:45Z

This error is occurring because the cost estimation service doesn't have pricing data for resources in the eu-west-3 AWS region. This typically happens when:

1. You're using a newer AWS region that isn't fully integrated with the Terraform Cloud cost estimation service yet
2. You're using resources that don't have standard pricing data available

Options to resolve this:
1. Consider using an AWS region that has full cost estimation support, like us-east-1, us-west-2, or eu-west-1
2. You can still proceed with your infrastructure changes, but you won't get accurate cost estimates
3. Contact Terraform Cloud support if you need cost estimation support for this specific region

## Comparing Multiple Cost Estimates

**User:** I want to compare the cost estimates from my last two runs to see which one is more cost-effective.

**Claude:** I'll help you compare the cost estimates from your last two runs.

```python
from terraform_cloud_mcp.tools import runs, cost_estimates
import asyncio
import pandas as pd
from tabulate import tabulate

async def compare_cost_estimates(run_ids):
    results = []
    
    for run_id in run_ids:
        # Get run details
        run_result = await runs.get_run_details(run_id)
        
        # Skip if error
        if "error" in run_result:
            results.append({
                "run_id": run_id, 
                "error": run_result["error"]
            })
            continue
            
        run_data = run_result.get("data", {})
        run_attributes = run_data.get("attributes", {})
        
        # Extract cost estimate ID
        relationships = run_data.get("relationships", {})
        cost_estimate_data = relationships.get("cost-estimate", {}).get("data", {})
        
        if not cost_estimate_data:
            results.append({
                "run_id": run_id,
                "message": "No cost estimate found",
                "run_message": run_attributes.get("message", "No message")
            })
            continue
            
        cost_estimate_id = cost_estimate_data.get("id")
        
        # Get cost estimate details
        ce_result = await cost_estimates.get_cost_estimate_details(cost_estimate_id)
        
        if "error" in ce_result:
            results.append({
                "run_id": run_id,
                "cost_estimate_id": cost_estimate_id,
                "error": ce_result["error"]
            })
            continue
            
        # Extract cost data
        ce_data = ce_result.get("data", [{}])[0]
        ce_attributes = ce_data.get("attributes", {})
        
        results.append({
            "run_id": run_id,
            "cost_estimate_id": cost_estimate_id,
            "run_message": run_attributes.get("message", "No message"),
            "status": ce_attributes.get("status"),
            "prior_monthly_cost": float(ce_attributes.get("prior-monthly-cost", 0)),
            "proposed_monthly_cost": float(ce_attributes.get("proposed-monthly-cost", 0)),
            "delta_monthly_cost": float(ce_attributes.get("delta-monthly-cost", 0)),
            "resources_count": ce_attributes.get("resources-count", 0)
        })
    
    return results

# Your last two run IDs
run_ids = ["run-pQtfN5XSe8zaJ2UF", "run-aB3cD4eF5gH6iJ7k"]
comparison = asyncio.run(compare_cost_estimates(run_ids))
```

Here's a comparison of the cost estimates from your last two runs:

| Run | Message | Prior Cost | Proposed Cost | Change | Resources |
|-----|---------|------------|---------------|--------|-----------|
| run-pQtfN5XSe8zaJ2UF | Add Redis cluster | $127.32 | $158.76 | +$31.44 | 18 |
| run-aB3cD4eF5gH6iJ7k | Optimize compute resources | $158.76 | $142.18 | -$16.58 | 18 |

Based on this comparison:

1. The first run adds a Redis cluster, increasing your monthly costs by $31.44
2. The second run optimizes your compute resources, decreasing your monthly costs by $16.58

The second run is more cost-effective, saving you $16.58 per month compared to the first run. However, note that the runs have different purposes - one adds functionality while the other optimizes costs. The most cost-effective choice depends on whether you need the Redis cluster functionality.

**User:** That's helpful! How can I get more detailed information about which resources contribute the most to my costs?

**Claude:** To get more detailed information about which resources contribute most to your costs, I'll need to analyze the "resources" field in the cost estimate response. Let me show you how:

```python
from terraform_cloud_mcp.tools import cost_estimates
import asyncio
import pandas as pd
from tabulate import tabulate

async def analyze_cost_resources(cost_estimate_id):
    # Get the cost estimate details
    result = await cost_estimates.get_cost_estimate_details(cost_estimate_id)
    
    if "error" in result:
        return {"error": result["error"]}
    
    cost_data = result.get("data", [{}])[0]
    attributes = cost_data.get("attributes", {})
    
    # Extract the resources data which contains detailed cost breakdowns
    resources = attributes.get("resources", {})
    
    # Create a structured analysis
    resource_costs = []
    for resource_key, resource_data in resources.items():
        # Extract the resource type and name
        parts = resource_key.split(".")
        if len(parts) >= 2:
            resource_type = parts[0]
            resource_name = ".".join(parts[1:])
        else:
            resource_type = resource_key
            resource_name = "unknown"
            
        # Extract the cost data
        cost_components = resource_data.get("cost_components", [])
        monthly_cost = sum(float(comp.get("monthly_cost", 0)) for comp in cost_components)
        
        # Add to our analysis
        resource_costs.append({
            "resource_type": resource_type,
            "resource_name": resource_name,
            "monthly_cost": monthly_cost,
            "components": len(cost_components)
        })
    
    # Sort by cost (highest first)
    resource_costs.sort(key=lambda x: x["monthly_cost"], reverse=True)
    
    # Get cost by resource type
    costs_by_type = {}
    for resource in resource_costs:
        r_type = resource["resource_type"]
        if r_type not in costs_by_type:
            costs_by_type[r_type] = 0
        costs_by_type[r_type] += resource["monthly_cost"]
    
    type_costs = [{"type": k, "monthly_cost": v} for k, v in costs_by_type.items()]
    type_costs.sort(key=lambda x: x["monthly_cost"], reverse=True)
    
    return {
        "total_monthly_cost": attributes.get("proposed-monthly-cost"),
        "resource_count": attributes.get("resources-count"),
        "top_resources": resource_costs[:10],  # Top 10 most expensive resources
        "costs_by_type": type_costs
    }

# Using a cost estimate ID from your runs
cost_analysis = asyncio.run(analyze_cost_resources("ce-8cZKNpyP3R2fBaXD"))
```

Based on the analysis of your cost estimate, here are the key insights:

### Top Resource Types by Cost
1. **aws_instance**: $72.34/month (45.6% of total costs)
2. **aws_rds_cluster**: $45.60/month (28.7% of total costs) 
3. **aws_elasticache_cluster**: $31.44/month (19.8% of total costs)
4. **aws_s3_bucket**: $5.62/month (3.5% of total costs)
5. **aws_ebs_volume**: $3.76/month (2.4% of total costs)

### Top Individual Resources
1. **aws_rds_cluster.primary**: $45.60/month
   - Main database cluster
   - Components: Instance costs, storage costs, backup costs
   
2. **aws_instance.web_servers[4]**: $14.47/month
   - Web server instance #4 (t3.large)
   - Components: Compute hours, storage
   
3. **aws_instance.web_servers[3]**: $14.47/month
   - Web server instance #3 (t3.large)
   - Components: Compute hours, storage
   
4. **aws_elasticache_cluster.redis_primary**: $31.44/month
   - Redis cluster (cache.m5.large)
   - Components: Node hours, memory allocation
   
5. **aws_instance.application_server**: $14.60/month
   - Application server (t3.large)
   - Components: Compute hours, storage

### Cost Optimization Recommendations

Based on this cost breakdown, here are some opportunities to reduce costs:

1. **Right-size your instances**: Some of your web servers might be over-provisioned. Consider using t3.medium instead of t3.large for less critical workloads.

2. **Use reserved instances**: Your EC2 instances account for nearly half of your costs. Consider purchasing reserved instances for stable workloads to save 30-60% on your EC2 costs.

3. **Optimize your Redis usage**: Your Redis cluster represents a significant cost. Consider whether you need the current size or if a smaller instance would suffice.

4. **Review your RDS cluster**: Your RDS cluster is your second-highest cost. Review if you need all the provisioned resources or if you could use a smaller instance type.

5. **S3 lifecycle policies**: For your S3 buckets, implement lifecycle policies to transition infrequently accessed data to cheaper storage classes.
